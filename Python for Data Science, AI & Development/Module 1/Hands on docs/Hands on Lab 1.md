# Reading: Format Strings in Python

**Estimated effort:** 5 mins

Format strings are a way to inject variables into a string in Python. They are used to format strings and produce more human-readable outputs. There are several ways to format strings in Python:

## String Interpolation (f-strings)

Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings are a new way to format strings in Python. They are prefixed with 'f' and use curly braces {} to enclose the variables that will be formatted. For example:
```python
name = "John"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```
This will output:
```
My name is John and I am 30 years old.
```
## str.format()

This is another way to format strings in Python. It uses curly braces {} as placeholders for variables which are passed as arguments in the format() method. For example:
```
name = "John"
age = 50
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
```
This will output:
```
My name is John and I am 50 years old.
```
## % Operator

This is one of the oldest ways to format strings in Python. It uses the % operator to replace variables in the string. For example:
```
name = "Johnathan"
age = 30
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
```
This will output:
```
My name is Johnathan and I am 30 years old.
```
### Explanation of % Operator
```
- "My name is %s and I am %d years old.": This is a string that includes format specifiers:
  - %s: This is a placeholder for a string.
  - %d: This is a placeholder for an integer.
- % (name, age): This is a tuple containing the variables name and age. The values of these variables will replace the placeholders in the string.
```
Each of these methods has its own advantages and use cases. However, f-strings are generally considered the most modern and preferred way to format strings in Python due to their readability and performance.

## Additional Capabilities of f-strings

F-strings are also able to evaluate expressions inside the curly braces, which can be very handy. For example:
```
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of x and y is {x+y}.")
```
This will output:
```
The sum of x and y is 30.
```
## Raw Strings (r'')

In Python, raw strings are a powerful tool for handling textual data, especially when dealing with escape characters. By prefixing a string literal with the letter 'r', Python treats the string as raw, meaning it interprets backslashes as literal characters rather than escape sequences.

### Example of Regular String vs Raw String

#### Regular String:
```
regular_string = "C:\new_folder\file.txt"
print("Regular String:", regular_string)
```
This will output:
```
Regular String: C:
ew_folder
ile.txt
```
In the regular string regular_string variable, the backslashes (\n) are interpreted as escape sequences. Therefore, \n represents a newline character, which would lead to an incorrect file path representation.

#### Raw String:
```
raw_string = r"C:\new_folder\file.txt"
print("Raw String:", raw_string)
```
This will output:
```
Raw String: C:\new_folder\file.txt
```
In the raw string raw_string, the backslashes are treated as literal characters. This means that \n is not interpreted as a newline character, but rather as two separate characters, \ and n. Consequently, the file path is represented exactly as it appears.

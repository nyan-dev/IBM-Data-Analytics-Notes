Practice Quiz 

Question 1
What are the requirements in order for data to be reliable? (Select all that apply)  
Data should be structured
Data should be easy to collect   
Data should be free of all errors (ans)
Data should be relevant (ans)

Explanation:
Free of all errors: Reliable data must be accurate and error-free to ensure trustworthiness.
Relevant: The data must be pertinent to the context or purpose for which it is used, ensuring it is meaningful.
The other options, while useful, do not directly determine reliability:

Structured: While structured data is easier to manage, unstructured or semi-structured data can still be reliable if accurate and relevant.
Easy to collect: Data collection ease is not a reliability criterion; even complex data can be reliable if properly handled.

Question 2
What type of data is produced by wearable devices, smart buildings, and medical devices?  
Observation study data
Census data
Sensor data (ans)
Survey data

Question 3
What type of data is semi-structured and has some organizational properties but not a rigid schema?
Online forms   
Data from OLTP systems
Emails
Web logs (answer)

Online Forms: Semi-structured
Online forms often store data in formats like JSON or XML, which have an organized structure but not a rigid schema. The fields may vary based on the form design.

Data from OLTP Systems: Structured
OLTP systems (Online Transaction Processing) store data in relational databases with a fixed schema (e.g., tables with defined rows and columns).

Emails: Semi-structured
Emails have structured headers (e.g., sender, recipient, timestamp) and unstructured body text, making them semi-structured.

Web Logs: Semi-structured
Web logs contain organized fields like timestamps, IP addresses, and URLs, but the format is not as rigid, making them semi-structured.

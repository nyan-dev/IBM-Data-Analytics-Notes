Question 1
What are the requirements in order for data to be reliable? (Select all that apply)

The other options, while useful, do not directly determine reliability:

Structured: While structured data is easier to manage, unstructured or semi-structured data can still be reliable if accurate and relevant.
Easy to collect: Data collection ease is not a reliability criterion; even complex data can be reliable if properly handled.

Data from OLTP systems
Emails (ans)

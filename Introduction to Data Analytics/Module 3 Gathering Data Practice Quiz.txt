Practice Quiz 

Question 1
What are the requirements in order for data to be reliable? (Select all that apply)  
Data should be structured
Data should be easy to collect   
Data should be free of all errors (ans)
Data should be relevant (ans)

Explanation:
Free of all errors: Reliable data must be accurate and error-free to ensure trustworthiness.
Relevant: The data must be pertinent to the context or purpose for which it is used, ensuring it is meaningful.
The other options, while useful, do not directly determine reliability:

Structured: While structured data is easier to manage, unstructured or semi-structured data can still be reliable if accurate and relevant.
Easy to collect: Data collection ease is not a reliability criterion; even complex data can be reliable if properly handled.

Question 2
What type of data is produced by wearable devices, smart buildings, and medical devices?  
Observation study data
Census data
Sensor data (ans)
Survey data

Question 3
What type of data is semi-structured and has some organizational properties but not a rigid schema?
Online forms   
Data from OLTP systems
Emails (ans)
Web logs 

Explanation:
Emails are semi-structured data because:

They have organizational properties like headers (e.g., sender, recipient, timestamp), which are structured.
The body content is unstructured, lacking a rigid schema, making emails semi-structured.
